# This property is used to indicate that the client in your application is a public client.
# This triggers Keycloak to apply additional security measures suitable for public clients.
# I was just reviewing my code few hours before the submission deadline and remembered this one. My client is changed into
# a confidential one (in Keycloak) and the reason is stated in the report. I don't have enough time to change it and test
# everything again. So I'm keeping it, as it is, since everything is working fine.

# This property is important. First, it specifies that our java program is a bearer-only application. Bearer-only applications
# do not initiate the authentication process itself, but rely on externally authenticated tokens to authorize access to
# their resources. In this case, Keycloak is the provider of the bearer tokens.

# For further information
# When a client logs in, it gets an access token of bearer type from Keycloak. The client then includes this token in its
# requests to the application. Then the application checks with Keycloak if the token is valid in order to proceed with
# the request. If it is, the application decode the token to extract its role.
